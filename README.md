# Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-the-MNIST-Dataset

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning and consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each sized 28x28 pixels.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture consists of the following layers:
- Convolutional Layer 1: 32 filters, kernel size of 3x3, ReLU activation
- Max Pooling Layer 1: Pool size of 2x2
- Convolutional Layer 2: 64 filters, kernel size of 3x3, ReLU activation
- Max Pooling Layer 2: Pool size of 2x2
- Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D matrix to a 1D vector
- Dense Layer: 128 neurons with ReLU activation
- Dropout Layer: 50% dropout rate to reduce overfitting
- Output Layer: 10 neurons with softmax activation for multi-class classification

## Training and Evaluation
- The model is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 128.
- 20% of the training data is used for validation.
- The model is evaluated on the test dataset, and the accuracy is printed.

## Results Visualization
The performance of the model is visualized using a confusion matrix, which displays the true vs. predicted classifications. This helps in understanding where the model is making correct predictions and where it is misclassifying.

## Potential Improvements
To enhance the model's accuracy, consider the following strategies:
1. Data Augmentation: Apply transformations such as rotation, zoom, and shifts to increase the diversity of the training dataset.
2. Regularization Techniques: Implement L2 regularization or additional dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different architectures, learning rates, and batch sizes.
4. Advanced Architectures: Explore deeper CNN architectures or utilize transfer learning with pre-trained models.
5. Ensemble Methods: Combine predictions from multiple models to improve overall performance.
